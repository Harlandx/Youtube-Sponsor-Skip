# YouTube Sponsor Skip Chrome Extension

A Chrome extension that automatically skips sponsor segments and creator ads in YouTube videos.

## Features

- ðŸš« **Automatic Sponsor Skip**: Detects and skips sponsor segments in YouTube videos
- ðŸ“Š **SponsorBlock Integration**: Uses the community-driven SponsorBlock database
- ðŸŽ¯ **Smart Detection**: Skips creator ads, not YouTube's monetization ads
- ðŸ“ˆ **Real-time Stats**: Track how many segments you've skipped
- ðŸ”§ **Easy Controls**: Simple toggle on/off functionality
- ðŸŽ¨ **Clean UI**: Modern popup interface with statistics

## How It Works

The extension uses multiple methods to detect sponsor segments:

1. **SponsorBlock API**: Leverages the community database of sponsor segments
2. **Time-based Detection**: Identifies common sponsor segment patterns
3. **Smart Skipping**: Only skips creator-inserted ads, preserving YouTube's revenue model
